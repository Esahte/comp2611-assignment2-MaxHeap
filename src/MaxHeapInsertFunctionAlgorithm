Start with the root node of the max heap.
If the root node is null, set the new node as the root and return.
Compare the value of the new node with the value of the current node.
If the value of the new node is greater than the value of the current node, swap the values of the new node and the current node.
Check if the left child of the current node is null.
If the left child is null, insert the new node as the left child of the current node.
If the left child is not null, check if the right child is null.
If the right child is null, insert the new node as the right child of the current node.
If both the left and right children are present, compare their depth.
Insert the new node into the most shallow child (left or right).
Repeat steps 3 to 10, recursively, starting from the child node where you inserted the new node.
Continue this process until the new node is correctly placed in the max heap.
