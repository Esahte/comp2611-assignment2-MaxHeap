1. Start at the bottom level of the heap (i.e., the last leaf node on the last level).
2. Insert the new element in the last position of the heap.
3. Compare the newly inserted element with its parent.
4. If the parent is smaller than the newly inserted element, swap them.
5. Repeat step 3 and step 4 until the heap property is restored (i.e., the parent is not smaller than the newly
inserted element) or until the newly inserted element reaches the root of the heap.
